Events
-
Like any loader and stuff, LoaderComplex provides a simple but very limited way to listen to events happening in the game.
Here are listed the events LC supports as time of writing ( API level 0.2.0 is required )

| Event id               | EventData class     | Description                                     |
|------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| lc.client.chat.send    | ClientChatEventData | Invoked when the player tries to send a message |
| lc.server.chat.receive | ServerChatEventData | Invoked when the server receives a message      |
|                        |                     |                                                 |
|                        |                     |                                                 |
|                        |                     |                                                 |
