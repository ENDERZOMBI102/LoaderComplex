Events
-
Like any loader and stuff, LoaderComplex provides a simple but very limited way to listen to events happening in the game.
Here are listed the events LC supports as time of writing ( API level 0.2.0 is required )

| Event id               | EventData class     | Description |
|------------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| lc.client.chat.send    | ClientChatEventData |             |
| lc.server.chat.receive | ServerChatEventData |             |
|                        |                     |             |
|                        |                     |             |
|                        |                     |             |
