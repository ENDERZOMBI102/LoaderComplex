        This is responsible for getting the BakedModel instance for an ItemStack,
        If i'd have to act somewhere, i'd act here.

        ItemModels instance is created here!
        maybe there's something we can do?
        I checked, the model ( `test:mud#inventory` ) exists in the BakedModelRegistry, so why is it not used by the game?
        THIS is what we need to find out

        Here's something fun, there items are registered to be then loaded, but adding custom items to that map
        will do nothing, why? idfk you gotta guess.
        There are more interesting methods in there, its worth giving it a look.
